# Management System Features

## Problems:

## Circular stage designs: how to avoid wasting materials.
“Every time we don’t know who has the materials, so we end up buying new ones.”

## Issue:
-Inefficient management of stage materials and available technologies (equipment, microphones, setups, etc.), which often get lost or damaged.

## Approach:
-Create a digital and physical system for booking, exchanging, and reusing materials, imagining different models (e.g., free exchange between theater companies, paid rentals for external users, etc.).
